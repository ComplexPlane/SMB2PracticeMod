# HOW TO BUILD ME:
# 
# To turn into a Gecko code:
# - Get CodeWrite: https://github.com/TheGag96/CodeWrite
# - Use 80006d08 as insertion address
# - Paste in asm and generate Gecko codes
# - Prepend this line to generated Gecko code: 040044C0 72656C00
#
# To turn into a .gct for use with Nintendont:
# - Build Gecko code with CodeWrite like above
# - Get Gecko Code Manager: https://www.zeldacodes.org/downloads/code-manager
# - Set GM2E8P gamecode
# - Add a code, paste in Gecko, save modifications, export to GCT

# SMB2 Workshop Mod writes a ModLink struct to 0x800a9cb4 after it loads.
#
# ModLink format:
#
# 0x0:  u32 magic; // 0xFEEDC0DE
# 0x4:  u16 modlink_semver_major; 
# 0x6:  u16 modlink_semver_minor;
# 0x8:  u16 modlink_semver_patch;
# 0xA:  u16 padding_0xA;
# 0xC:  u16 wsmod_semver_major;
# 0xE:  u16 wsmod_semver_minor;
# 0x10: u16 wsmod_semver_patch;
# 0x12: u16 padding2;
# 0x14: void* (*malloc_func)(u32 size);
# 0x18: HeapInfo* heap_info;
