# SMB2 Practice Mod Console Setup Guide

1. Homebrew your Wii using [this guide](https://wii.guide), up to and including installing the Homebrew channel. I
   highly recommend following the Letterbomb homebrew method over other methods, it's super reliable and easy.
2. Install [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont) on your Wii. **Make sure your Nintendont version is from
   2019 or newer**, older versions may fail to load the practice mod. You can check your version in the Nintendont
   settings screen, or just upgrade to the latest version.
3. Download the `.zip` file containing the release (_not_ the source code). Releases are
   found [here](https://github.com/complexplane/apesphere/releases). Open up the `.zip` file (you don't necessarily need
   to extract it).
4. Plug in your SD card, flash drive, hard drive, etc. which has your homebrew files on it. If you intend to play a ISO
   file, the practice mod must go on the same SD card/flash drive/etc. as the ISO file.
5. On your homebrew SD card, if you have any game data on a virtual memory card in Slot B for Super Monkey Ball 2,
   you're going to want to back it up as the practice mod will replace it. It will be the file `saves/GM2E_B.raw`. If
   you don't have this file or don't know what I'm talking about, you're probably fine.
6. Drag the `codes` and `saves` folders from the `.zip` release you downloaded to your SD card. If asked to replace
   files, choose Yes.
7. Plug your SD card back into your Wii and boot up Nintendont.
8. In Nintendont, press B to go to options. **Enable** Cheats, Unlock Read Speed, Memcard Emulation, and Native
   Control. **Disable** Memcard Multi.
9. Boot the game from disc or ISO file like usual.

If you see the "SMB2 Practice Mod" text in place of the normal "Press Start" text on the title screen when you start the
game, you've loaded the mod successfully. If you don't see this, the mod is definitely not loaded correctly, go back and
and check to make sure you didn't miss a step. If you can't figure it out, feel free to message me on
Discord (`ComplexPlane#3111`) or email (`complexplanegames@gmail.com`), or file a Github issue.
